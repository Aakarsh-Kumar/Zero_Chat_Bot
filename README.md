# Zero Chat Bot
This is my chatbot Zero, it is made by using a simple probability-based model and natural language processing. Just edit the database, give him any dialogs, or feed him with other datasets and have fun. After all, a machine is as evil as his master, isn't it? <br />

This repo contains two versions of chatbot
- offline chatbot <br />
This is a simple plug and plays bot so just open and download all dependencies, run the code and have fun.
- online chatbot : <br />
this is an online chatbot it uses firebase, Twilio, etc. and an app to connect to this server. online chatbot code will be executed locally on the machine and will be listening to apps on mobile over the internet. So please set up a twillio, firebase account before using it, Thankyou.
